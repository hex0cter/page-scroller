# page-scroller
Chrome extension for scrolling your webpage without moving your palm. By default the browser only allows you
to scroll the page by the arrow key, or page up/down key. Those keys are usually located at the edge of
the keyboard. As a result you will have to move your hand around when you scroll.

This extension allows you to scroll with the H, J, K, L key, just as in vim, or the A, W, S, D key just
like you do in a PC game.

## Install
You can install the extension from [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-scroller/gkhebpnlfbdhbhnlgdpcpidkcgmmhdhp?hl=en).
